# PolyCalculator

## Overview

This repository contains a Haskell-based project designed to manipulate polynomials with precision and scalability. It efficiently parses polynomial strings into a robust internal representation, performs algebraic operations such as addition, multiplication, and differentiation, and outputs the results in a clear, user-friendly format.

## Features

- **Parsing & Representation:**  
  Converts polynomial expressions from strings into an internal structure that separates coefficients, variables, and exponents.

- **Normalization:**  
  Automatically combines like terms, orders variables alphabetically, and removes zero coefficient terms.

- **Arithmetic Operations:**  
  Supports addition, multiplication (via the distributive property), and differentiation with respect to any variable.

- **User-Friendly Output:**  
  Translates the internal representation back into a well-formatted polynomial string.
  
## Future Enhancements
While all core functionalities are complete, continuous testing and minor optimizations will be pursued to further improve performance and reliability.
